Another nifty script for OmniFocus. It's called [Fixxxer](https://github.com/brandonpittman/OmniFocus). It does two things. If you run it with no arguments, it will remove **colonized** prefixes from task names. If you pass it an argument, it will **add** that argument as a prefix to selected tasks. It's LaunchBar-ready. If you want to turn off the confirmation dialog, set `nagMePlease` to `false`.

```applescript
use AppleScript version "2.4" -- Yosemite (10.10) or later
use scripting additions
use O : script "omnifocus"
use OmniFocus : application "OmniFocus"
-- If you want to play it safe, set nagMePlease to true
property nagMePlease : true

on run
	if nagMePlease then
		set question to display dialog "Do you want to remove all prefixes?"
		if button returned of question is "OK" then
			removePrefixes()
		end if
	else
		removePrefixes()
	end if
end run

on handle_string(argv)
	tell O to setPrefix(selectedItems(), argv)
end handle_string

on removePrefixes()
	tell O to clearPrefixAll(selectedItems())
	display notification Â¬
		"All prefixes removed." with title "Fixxxer"
end removePrefixes
```
