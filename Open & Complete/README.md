# Open & Complete

This script is old and has changed greatly. It was once a very specialized script for just myself, but I've made it a general opener and exteneded it after seeing "Go to Link" from somewhere.

You can use a URL, `sh /path/to/some/script`, a rich text link, a file attachment, `App: App Name`, `Alert: Some alert text`, and `Notify: Some Notification`.

Be advised, you must have tasks selected.
