OmniFocus
===========

## StickyFocus
Handy AppleScript for creating [Sticky Notifications](http://instinctivecode.com/sticky-notifications/) from OmniFocus tasks. The script will take any selected project or task in OmniFocus and create a Sticky Notification using the Sticky Notification URL scheme.

## SmartPerspective

Handy AppleScript for smartly opening the perspective you *should* be looking at.

## Birthdays2OmniFocus

Create a "Birthdays" project in OmniFocus and create birthday reminders for each person with a birthday assigned in your OS X Contacts.app.

*Release Notes (1.0)*

This is the 1.0 push. It works well for adding the initial birthday reminders. It will create the "Birthdays" project if it doesn't already exist. It references a "Communications" perspective but doesn't create it as of now. You can run it later on to update the project with new birthday reminders and it checks if each birthday already exists in OmniFocus. I'm not totally sure why, but it will occasionally go wonky and create multiple entries.
